g2k_lib's documentation
=======================

:Version: 0.0.1
:Author: Remy Leroy
:Date: Jan. 2018

This module aims to provide several methods to compute iteratively convergence maps from shear maps under FITS format.

Installation
============

* You can either install it as a regular package by typing ``sudo python setup.py install`` in a shell

**OR**

* just install all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using the following command: ``sudo pip install -r requirements.txt``

Contents

   g2k_lib


Features
========

This package contains an executable pyton file `run.py` that allows the user to perform several actions which are:
* Computation of convergence maps by calling the ``compute`` action.
* Evaluation of the error with respect to a reference convergence map by calling the ``evaluate`` action.
* Plot error curves by calling the ``visualize`` action.

A call is done as follows: ``./run.py <action> <parameters>``.
Each action takes its owns set of parameters.

Use ``./run.py <action> --help`` to get a list of all the parameters the action can take.


Examples
========

Let's suppose the data to be processed are located in the `./data` folder as follows:
::

    .
    ├── configs/
    │   ├── rConfigs.json
    │   └── vConfigs.json
    |
    ├── data/
    │   ├── convergence_maps.fits
    │   ├── mask.fits
    │   └── shear_maps.fits
    |
    ├── g2k_lib/
    │   ├── dct_interpolation.py
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── metrics.py
    │   ├── objects.py
    │   ├── operations.py
    │   ├── projection_methods.py
    │   ├── visuals.py
    ├── MANIFEST.in
    ├── README.md
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── run.py
    └── setup.py


Where `mask.fits` is a binary map of missing data; `shear_maps.fits` consists in two shear maps (E-mode map and B-mode map); `convergence_maps.fits` is a simulated convergence map corresponding to `shear_maps.fits` that can be used as a ground truth map to evaluate the quality of reconstruction.

``compute`` action
------------------
``
./run.py compute --gamma ./data/shear_maps.fits  --mask ./data/mask.fits --method 'iKS' --niter 50 --bconstraint 10 --output ./data/result.fits
``
The above instruction will compute the convergence map corresponding to the given shear map, mask map and the method of computation; Here the result will be computed using the iterative Kaiser-Squires method for 50 iterations and with 10 pixels for border constraint and it will be stored into the `result.fits` file.

`result.fits` will contain two maps, one for each mode.


``evaluate`` action
-------------------

To evaluate the quality of the reconstruction, it is possible to compare `result.fits` with `convergence_maps.fits`, the ``evaluate`` action should be used to do so.

``
./run.py evaluate --kappa ./data/result.fits --gnd_truth ./data/convergence_maps.fits --output ./data/table.json
``
The error value will be stored into a JSON file corresponding to the method used to compute the estimated convergence map.
